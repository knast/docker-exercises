Creating a docker container and running it with a command: 

sudo docker container run -it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'

I've noticed that the curl is not installed, so I used the command 'exit'.

To start the container again, I've used a command: 'docker start CONTAINER_ID'

To access the CLI of ubuntu in container, I've used: 

sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME bash

And proceeded to install curl.

apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install curl

After that runned the script again and curl worked for helsinki.fi as mentioned in
exercise description.
